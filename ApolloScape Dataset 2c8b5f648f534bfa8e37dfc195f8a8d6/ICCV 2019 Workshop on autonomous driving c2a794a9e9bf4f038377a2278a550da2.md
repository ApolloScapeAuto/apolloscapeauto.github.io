# Introduction

The ICCV 2019 Workshop on Autonomous Driving — beyond single frame perception builds on the [CVPR 2019 Workshop on Autonomous Driving](https://web.archive.org/web/20220530031944/http://wad.ai/2019/index.html) with a focus on multi-frame perception, prediction, and planning for autonomous driving. It aims to get together researchers and engineers from academia and industries to discuss computer vision applications in autonomous driving. In this one day workshop, we will have invited speakers, panel discussions, and technical benchmark challenges to present the current state of the art, as well as the limitations and future directions for computer vision in autonomous driving, arguably the most promising application of computer vision and AI in general.
