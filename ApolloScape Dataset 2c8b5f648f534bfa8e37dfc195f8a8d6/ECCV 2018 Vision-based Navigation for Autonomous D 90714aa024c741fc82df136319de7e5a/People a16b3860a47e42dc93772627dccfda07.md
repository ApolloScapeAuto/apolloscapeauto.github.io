[Andreas Geiger](https://ps.is.tuebingen.mpg.de/person/ageiger)

Andreas, Geiger (MPI/ETH-Zurich) is a Max Planck Research Group Leader at the MPI for Intelligent Systems in Tu ̈bingen and a Visiting Professor at ETH Zu ̈rich. His research interests are at the intersection of 3D reconstruction, 3D motion estimation and visual scene understanding with a particular focus on integrating rich prior knowledge and deep learning for improving perception in intelligent systems. In 2012, he has published the KITTI vision benchmark suite which has become one of the most influential test beds for evaluating stereo, optical flow, scene flow, detection, tracking, motion estimation and segmentation algorithms. He also serves as an area chair and associate editor for the most important computer vision conferences and journals (CVPR, ICCV, ECCV, PAMI, IJCV).
