# Tutorial

# Apollo, Open Autonomous Driving Platform

# Introduction

Apollo is the largest open autonomous driving platform with a full stack of H/W and S/W developed by the autonomous driving community. We will present the ongoing research in Apollo and discuss about future direction of autonomous driving. We will mainly discuss 5 topics: perception, simulation, sensor fusion, localization, and control: 1) Perception: we will review pros and cons of each sensor and discuss what functionality and level of autonomy can be achieved with such sensors. We will also discuss the main issues to reach L4 autonomy with cameras. 2) Simulation: we will demonstrate game-engine based simulation for training and evaluation of perception algorithms using camera and lidar sensors. 3) Sensor fusion: we will present how to learn a prior and belief function of each sensor and fuse all sensor output using Dempster-Shafer theory. 4) Localization: we will present a highly precise localization algorithm integrating GNSS, IMU, camera, and lidar. 5) Control: We will also explain how to perform multiple iteration optimization in planning and introduce a learning-based dynamic control modeling and its application in simulation.

The tutorial will be held in **Monday, June 17 9am**. The location is Long Beach Convention Center, Room **203B**.
