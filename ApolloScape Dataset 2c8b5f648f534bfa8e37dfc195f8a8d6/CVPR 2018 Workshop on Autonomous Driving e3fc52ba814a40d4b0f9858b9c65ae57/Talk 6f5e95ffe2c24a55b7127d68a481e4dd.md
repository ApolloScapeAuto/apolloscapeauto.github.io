[Will Maddern](https://web.archive.org/web/20190519102904/http:/wad.ai/2018/talk.html#Will_Maddern) (Nuro)

Computer vision, machine learning and robotics are converging to offer tangible improvements to everyday life in the very near future. In this talk I will cover recent work at Oxford on leveraging SLAM, computer vision and deep learning to enable long-term on-road autonomy in challenging outdoor environments, and preview our work at Nuro towards leveraging mobile robotics technology to deliver the future of local commerce, autonomously.

I'll describe some interesting properties of applied machine learning problems for autonomous vehicles, share some stories and lessons from the trenches at Tesla, and highlight certain research areas that could make a large impact in the space.
